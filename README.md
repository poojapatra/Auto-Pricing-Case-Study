# Auto-Pricing-Case-Study

1. I build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of car prices.
2. I have done the model building and residual analysis, and have made predictions on the test set.

Conclusion
This will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business 
   strategy etc. to meet certain price levels.
